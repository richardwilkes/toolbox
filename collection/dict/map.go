// Functions in this pcakge are only here because the Go team decided not to bring them over in the Go 1.21 maps package
// when they migrated the existing code from golang.org/x/exp/maps. Why, I'm not sure, since these can be useful.
//
// I chose not to use the package name "maps" to avoid collisions with the standard library. Unlike with the "slices"
// package, though, I couldn't use "map", since that's a keyword.

// Keys returns the keys of the map m. The keys will be in an indeterminate order.
