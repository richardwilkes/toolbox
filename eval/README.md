# evaluator

Simple expression evaluator

## Status

The `float64eval` package contains the operators and functions for a version that uses float64 numbers, while the
`f64d4eval` package contains the operators and functions for a version that used fixed-point numbers (specifically, the
github.`com/richardwilkes/toolbox/xmath/fixed.F64d4` type).

Support for other numeric types is easily added. Currently, however, only the two numeric types are currently
implemented.
