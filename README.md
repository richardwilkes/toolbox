# toolbox
Toolbox for Go.

> NOTE: This library already had a v1.x.y when Go modules were first introduced. Due to this, it doesn't follow the
>       normal convention and instead treats its releases as if they are of the v0.x.y variety (i.e. it could introduce
>       breaking API changes). Keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to use it.
