Toolbox for Go.

Contains a wide variety of code I've found useful in my own projects over the years. For cases where code exists to help
use standard library code, the package has been named the same as the standard library one, but with a preceeding "x"
(for extended). This allows both to be used in the same file without having to do import renaming.
